        This is a pop-up application that will help create a high
    quality 3d model of an Anglo-Saxon stone cross. There
    has been a revolution in 3d modelling in recent years
    and it is now relatively
    easy to construct such models from ordinary digital
    photographs. Isolating the objects depicted in these photographs,
    and masking out the background, is an important first step to achieving high
    quality results. The final 3d models will be made publicly
    available and are usefu not only for basic documentation purposes,
    but also for graphical displays in museums, for
    inclusion in gaming and virtual reality environments.</p>
        <p>
        We would like people to draw one or more polygons around the
    object that they see in each photograph in order to identify the
    outline of the object and exclude the image background. This allows
    the 3d modelling process to concentrate on the object itself and
    ignore irrelevant information.
        </p>

    <p>An example of one of these models has now been produced and can be <a target="_blank" href="http://micropasts.org/3D">seen here</a>.</p>
